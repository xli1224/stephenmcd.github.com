I've just released [Gnotty 0.2][gnotty-readme] with a handful of new features which I thought would be worthwhile writing about. I wrote in greater detail about Gnotty when it was [first released][gnotty-release], but if you missed that and are wondering what it is, it's an open source [Python][python] web application for managing an [IRC channel][irc]. It provides a chat interface using [WebSockets][websockets] and searchable message archive — both which support mobile devices using [responsive design][responsive-design]. It also comes with [programmable bots][irc-bots] you can use to build services around the IRC channel.

### What's New

Here's a list of the new features in 0.2:

 — Join and leave messages can now be filtered in chat and the message archive.
 — Next and previous day links in the message archive.
 — Consistent username colouring, now also implemented in the message archive.
 — A new `gnottify_runserver` Django management command, for running both the web and WebSocket servers together during development.
 — Bots now automatically reconnect (with exponential backoff) if they're disconnected from the channel.
 — A new `timer` event type has been added to the bot framework, for running periodic events.

### Push & Pull

The new timer events are quite simple on their own, but very interesting for Gnotty as a whole. As a feature, they simply provide the mechanism for bots to run events repeatedly at a given time interval. For Gnotty, this comes full circle in building bots that interact with external services and APIs. Since Gnotty's first release, it has supported having data *pushed* to it via [webhooks][webhooks] — custom HTTP endpoints used to send data to Gnotty, that a bot then acts upon. Now with timer events, data can be *pulled* by Gnotty from external sources as well.

Here's an example bot that implements a timer event. It uses [Mark Pilgrim's feedparser library][feedparser] to consume my blog's [RSS][rss] feed, posting new items to the IRC channel as they're discovered:

{% highlight python %}
from feedparser import parse
from gnotty.bots import BaseBot, events

class RSSBot(BaseBot):

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Store of retrieved feed items, so we only post them once.
        self.feed_items = set()
        # Consume initial feed items without posting them.
        self.parse_feed(message_channel=False)
        super(RSSBot, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    # Runs every 60 seconds
    @events.on("timer", seconds=60)
    def parse_feed(self, message_channel=True):
        for item in parse("http://blog.jupo.org/atom.xml").entries:
            if item["id"] not in self.feed_items:
                self.feed_items.add(item["id"])
                if message_channel:
                    self.message_channel("%(title)s: %(id)s" % item)
                    return
{% endhighlight %}

The above example is actually included in Gnotty with the 0.2 release, with a bit more functionality implemented around error handling, as well as supporting multiple feeds.

### Thank you

The best validation an open source project can receive is when other developers find the project useful enough to freely contribute back to it. Gnotty is off to a good start in this regard, and a big thanks goes to [Philip Neustrom][philipn], [Mike Waites][mikeywaites], and [Ken Bolton][kenbolton] for contributing features and fixes to Gnotty since its first release.

Do you have an idea for a cool feature Gnotty could provide? Go right ahead and send a pull request on either [GitHub][gnotty-github] or [Bitbucket][gnotty-bitbucket]!
