I recently started a new role at a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> shop, which as a long time <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> specialist was a really interesting opportunity. There's a lot of competition between the two frameworks' communities, ranging from friendly rivalry and respectful admiration at the mature end of the scale, to all out fanboy fuelled flame-wars at the other.

After you wade through the rivalry, the common wisdom voiced is that they're conceptually the same. If you know <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>, go with Django and if you know <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, go with Rails. After spending several months with Rails I can attest to this being true. At a bird's-eye view both frameworks contain almost identical concepts, implemented with different philosophies stemming from the ideals expressed by the languages they're written in. Both frameworks provide a vastly superior approach to security, modularity and rapid development than <a href="/2010/09/28/on-modern-web-development/">their predecessors do</a>.

An interesting question to ask would be: *which would be the best framework to choose, not knowing either language?* It would be naive of me to believe I am unbiased, but I would certainly recommend Django over Rails. The relative strictness of Python and explicitness of each component in Django, compared to the implicit magic in Rails, is simply much more geared towards creating large-scale systems in a sane and transparent way. To Ruby's credit though, I have developed a real admiration for the language itself, and have continued using it in my own projects — but that's a topic for <a href="/2012/02/27/my-baby-sinatra-apps/">another post</a>.

Considering how similar the two frameworks are component-wise, one thing I did miss was a side-by-side cheat sheet for working out what each of the concepts were in Rails that I already knew well in Django. I've put one together below to help out anyone who might be picking up either framework while already knowing the other. For clarity, I've also included descriptions of each type of component, for those who haven't used either framework.

Not all of these pairings are a perfect one-to-one match conceptually, but should be good enough to get an overall view of what each concept is within both frameworks.
