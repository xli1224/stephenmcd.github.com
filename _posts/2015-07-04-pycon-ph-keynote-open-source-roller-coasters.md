This year I was lucky enough to be invited to another PyCon â€” this time it was [PyCon Philippines](http://ph.pycon.org/), and I was invited to give the opening keynote speech no less! Initially I was stumped for talk ideas, so I [reached out](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mezzanine-users/27j441bzghk) to the Mezzanine community, who came back with a common theme: I should talk about the ups and downs of running a popular open source project.

I had a wonderful time, and a special thanks goes to all of the organisers, particularly [Micaela Reyes](https://twitter.com/codemickeycode), [Sony Valdez](https://twitter.com/MrValdez), and [Joy Lebrun](https://twitter.com/joy_lebrun) for being such warm hosts.

### Abstract

*In his opening keynote for PyCon PH 2015, Stephen McDonald takes us on a roller coaster ride through the thrilling highs and lows of running a successful open source project.*
