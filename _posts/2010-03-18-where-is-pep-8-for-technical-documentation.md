Anyone who has programmed in Python for a considerable length of time will at
least have some passing familiarity with [PEP
8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) — the document that goes into an
incredible level of detail in dictating precisely how code should be written.
While its primary goal is to ensure that Python code is written in a
consistent fashion throughout the community, therefore making it as easy as
possible to read, it also provides one of many aspects that makes programming
in Python an incredibly efficient process — it negates the need for a lot of
decision making around any of the choices one might come across that are
already covered in PEP 8.

I've recently been spending a lot of time writing technical documentation.
While it's been interesting doing something different for a change, the
perfectionist in me is constantly frustrated with finding myself using
inconsistent language across different sections when faced with the exact same
context, for example:

  * contains / has / includes / provides
  * discussed / referred to / described / mentioned
  * above / earlier / previously
  * below / later / next

Are these types of ambiguities in technical writing something that
professional editors typically deal with? What I'd love to see is something
like PEP 8 for technical documentation.
