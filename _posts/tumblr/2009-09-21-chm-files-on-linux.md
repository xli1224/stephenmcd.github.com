title: "CHM Files on Linux"
---

I think CHM files are great and my main Python reference is the CHM version of
the main documentation. I’ve used [GnoCHM](http://gnochm.sourceforge.net/)
which is the default CHM viewer for Gnome for quite a while and it’s really
poor - slow as hell on startup and segfaults half the time you click a link. I
finally gave up and looked for an alternative which I found in
[KchmViewer](http://www.kchmviewer.net/) which appears to be the default CHM
viewer for KDE. As usual the KDE counterpart of a given Gnome app is much
easier on the eyes and in this case the problems I had are solved - lightning
fast and stable.
