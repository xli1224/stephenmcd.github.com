I'd like to start this post off by apologising for the horrendous title, I should be ashamed of myself, and I actually am a little bit. I've just released [Mezzanine 3.1][mezzanine], and the workgroups title is a play on an [early version of Windows][windows-workgroups], a joke that only the most [hapless nerds][nerd-joke] would try and pull off - I guess that now also includes yours truly.

On a more serious note though, this Mezzanine release is huge. 3.1 is really what 3.0 should have been, which has had quite a rocky road over the last few months - upgrading to [Python 3.3][python], [Django 1.6][django] and [Bootstrap 3][bootstrap] all at once brought quite a few bugs along, but these have since been squashed and Mezzanine is now very stable.

### Looking Back

Every couple of years when milestones like this are reached, I like to take a look at the growth of Mezzanine and some of the statistics around it. You can see from the table below that growth has been consistent. Note that the [last time][mezzanine-1-release] I looked at these metrics, I also reported on the total number of mailing list messages and PyPI downloads, but this time I've excluded these as they're no longer available.

### What's New?

Along with a [great list of new features][mezzanine-31-release], such as the ability to [Tweet content from Mezzanine][mezzanine-tweeting], and [overhauled architecture documentation][architecture-docs], Mezzanine 3.1 brings a much improved admin interface.

<em class="center"><img src="/static/img/mezzanine-3.1-dashboard.png"><br>Mezzanine's admin dashboard</em>

Navigating to each section is now easier via the new left-hand menu, and usability has been improved overall with larger fonts and buttons. The beauty of this is that it's still the regular old Django admin system underneath - all your custom admin classes and third-party Django applications plug straight in with zero effort.

A massive thanks goes out to everyone who contributed features, fixes, and support on the mailing list. Mezzanine has never been this good, and it's all thanks to you.
